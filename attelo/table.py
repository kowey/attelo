    A graph can only be interpreted in light of a datapack.

    It has predictions and attach/label weights. Predictions work like
    `DataPack.target`. The weights are useful within parsing pipelines,
    where it is sometimes useful for an intermediary parser to manipulate
    the weight vectors that a parser may calculate downstream.

    See the parser interface for more details.

    Parameters
    ----------
    prediction: array(int)
        label for each edge (each cell corresponds to edge)
    attach: array(float)
        attachment weights (each cell corresponds to an edge)
    label: 2D array(float)
        label attachment weights (edge by label)

    Notes
    -----
    Predictions are always labels; however, datapack targets may also
    be -1/0/1 when adapted to binary attachment task

    A set of data that can be said to belong together.

    A typical use of the datapack would be to group together
    data for a single document/grouping. But in cases where
    this distinction does not matter, it can also be convenient
    to combine data from multiple documents into a single pack.

    Notes
    -----
    A datapack is said to be

    * single document (the usual case) it corresponds to a single
      document or "stacked" if it is made by joining multiple
      datapacks together. Some functions may only behave correctly
      on single-document datapacks
    * weighted if the graphs tuple is set. You should never see
      weighted datapacks outside of a learner or decoder

    Parameters
    ----------
    edus (EDU)
        effectively a set of edus
    pairings ([(EDU, EDU)])
        edu pairs
    data 2D array(float)
        sparse matrix of features, each
        row corresponding to a pairing
    target 1D array (should be int, really)
        array of predictions for each pairing
    labels ([string])
        list of relation labels (NB: by convention label zero
        is always the unknown label)
